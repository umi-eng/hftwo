# `hftwo`

For working with the [HF2 protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2) both as the host and the embedded device. As such this library is `no_std` compatible.

Why the name? `hf2` was already taken and only provides utility for the host component.

## Getting started

cargo add hftwo --git https://github.com/umi-eng/hftwo.git

## Features
